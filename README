Welcome to iU calculating language,
I created iU for a university project, where I had to use complex data types such as trees or linked lists.
iU is a very extensible calculating language, I say "Calculating language" because I wanted it to be used for large calulating tasks. 

iU features are the following:
  - Respect of mathematical calculating rules.
  - Understandable source code, for learning purposes.
  - Easy extentable.
  - Supports user variables. (per stack)
  - Support functions and constants which are defined within the source code.
  
iU Limits:
  - Week error handeling. 
  - User defined variables vanish once the thread ends.
  - Functions should be defined before compiling  iU. (static functions)

Notes:
  - The "=" operators returns as value the left operand (1 + y = 3+1, res = 5)
  - The "-","sin" and "cos" operators works in unary mode.
  - exp is not a function, but a variable, so you should do something like "e^3" using power operation.
